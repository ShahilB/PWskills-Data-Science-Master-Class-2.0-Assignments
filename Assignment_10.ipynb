    "### SQL Databases:\n",
    "- **Structure**: Relational databases that use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data.\n",
    "- **Schema**: Have a fixed schema, meaning the structure of data (tables, columns) is defined in advance.\n",
    "- **Tables**: Data is stored in tables with rows and columns.\n",
    "- **ACID Compliance**: Ensure Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which are important for reliable transactions.\n",
    "- **Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "- **Structure**: Non-relational databases that can store and retrieve data in a variety of formats like key-value pairs, documents, wide-columns, or graphs.\n",
    "- **Schema**: Typically schema-less or have a flexible schema, allowing for easy changes in the data structure.\n",
    "- **Storage Models**: Can use various data models, such as document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Designed for horizontal scaling and can handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "- **CAP Theorem**: Tend to focus on Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance, often trading off one for the others.\n",
    "- **Examples**: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, CouchDB, Neo4j.\n",
